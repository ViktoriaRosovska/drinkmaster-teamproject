Brandy generally contains 35\u201360 alcohol by volume (70\u2013120 US proof) and is typically taken as an after-dinner drink. Some brandies are aged in wooden casks, some are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of aging, and some brandies are produced using a combination of both aging and colouring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn broader sense, the term \\"brandy\\" also denotes liquors obtained from distillation of pomace (pomace brandy) or mash or wine of any other fruit (fruit brandy). These products are also named eaux-de-vie.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarieties of wine brandy can be found across the winemaking world. Among the most renowned are Cognac and Armagnac from southwestern France.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of brandy were clearly tied to the development of distillation. While the process was known in classical times, it wasn\'t used for significant beverage production until the 15th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially wine was distilled as a preservation method and as a way to make it easier for merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs described in the 1728 edition of Cyclopaedia, the following method was used to distill brandy:\\r\\n\\r\\nA cucurbit was filled half full of the liquor from which brandy was to be drawn and then raised with a little fire until about one sixth part was distilled, or until that which falls into the receiver was entirely flammable. This liquor, distilled only once, was called spirit of wine or brandy. Purified by another distillation (or several more), this was then called spirit of wine rectified. The second distillation was made in balneo mariae and in a glass cucurbit, and the liquor was distilled to about one half the quantity. This was further rectified\u2014as long as the operator thought necessary\u2014to produce brandy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo shorten these several distillations, which were long and troublesome, a chemical instrument was invented that reduced them to a single distillation. To test the purity of the rectified spirit of wine, a portion was ignited. If the entire contents were consumed by a fire without leaving any impurities behind, then the liquor was good. Another, better test involved putting a little gunpowder in the bottom of the spirit. If the gunpowder could ignite after the spirit was consumed by fire, then the liquor was good.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most brandies have been distilled from grapes, the regions of the world producing excellent brandies have roughly paralleled those areas producing grapes for viniculture. At the end of the 19th century, the western European markets, including by extension their overseas empires, were dominated by French and Spanish brandies and eastern Europe was dominated by brandies from the Black Sea region, including Bulgaria, the Crimea, and Georgia. In 1884, David Sarajishvili founded his brandy factory in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time. Armenian and Georgian brandies, called cognacs in the era, were considered some of the best in the world and often beat their French competitors at the International Expositions in Paris and Brussels in the early 1900s.[citation needed] The storehouses of the Romanov Court in St. Petersburg were regarded as the largest collections of cognacs and wines in the world with much of it from the Transcaucasus region of Georgia. During the October Revolution of 1917, upon the storming of the Winter Palace, the Bolshevik Revolution actually paused for a week or so as the participants gorged on the substantial stores of cognac and wines. The Russian market was always a huge brandy-consuming region in which home-grown varieties were common but much of it was imported. The patterns of bottles followed that of the western European norm. Throughout the Soviet era, the production of brandy was a source of pride for the communist regime as they continued to produce some excellent varieties, especially the most famous Jubilee Brandies of 1967, 1977, and 1987.[citation needed] Remaining bottles of these productions are highly sought after, not simply for their quality, but for their historical significance.","type":"Spirit","flavour":"grape","country":"United States"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb4b0"},"title":"Lemon vodka","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Lemon_vodka.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Lemon_vodka-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Lemon_vodka-Small.png","abv":"40","alcohol":"Yes","description":"Lemon vodka is a clear, lemon-flavoured vodka made with artificial flavouring, and is produced and sold by various brands.

The name is derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although it is unclear precisely what inspired the whiskey\'s name (contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans). Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The use of the term \\"bourbon\\" for the whiskey has been traced to the 1820s, and the term began to be used consistently in Kentucky in the 1870s. While bourbon may be made anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South, and with Kentucky in particular. As of 2014, the distillers\' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. is about $2.7 billion, and bourbon makes up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of bourbon is not well documented. There are many conflicting legends and claims, some more credible than others. For example, the invention of bourbon is often attributed to Elijah Craig, a Baptist minister and distiller credited with many Kentucky firsts (e.g., fulling mill, paper mill, ropewalk) who is also said to have been the first to age the product in charred oak casks, a process which gives bourbon its reddish color and distinctive taste. Across the county line in Bourbon County, an early distiller named Jacob Spears is credited with being the first to label his product as Bourbon whiskey. Spears\' home, Stone Castle, warehouse and spring house survive; one can drive by the Spears\' home on Clay-Kiser Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough still popular and often repeated, the Craig legend is apocryphal. Similarly, the Spears story is a local favorite, rarely repeated outside the county. There likely was no single \\"inventor\\" of bourbon, which developed into its present form only in the late 19th century. Essentially any type of grain can be used to make whiskey, and the practice of aging whiskey and charring the barrels for better flavour had also been known in Europe for centuries. The late date of the Bourbon County etymology has led Louisville historian Michael Veach to dispute its authenticity. He proposes that the whiskey was named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a major port where shipments of Kentucky whiskey sold well as a cheaper alternative to French cognac.\\r\\n\\r\\nDistilling probably was brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including English, Irish, Welsh, German and French) who began to farm the area in earnest. The spirit they made evolved, and became known as bourbon in the early 19th century due to its historical association with the geographic area known as Old Bourbon (this consisted of the original Bourbon County of Virginia as organized in 1785, a region that included much of today\'s Eastern Kentucky \u2013 including 34 of today\'s counties in Kentucky). This area included the current Bourbon County of Kentucky, which became a county of Kentucky when Kentucky was separated from Virginia as a new state in 1792.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen American pioneers pushed west of the Allegheny Mountains following the American Revolution, the first counties they founded covered vast regions. One of these original, huge counties was Bourbon, established in 1785 and named after the French royal family. While this vast county was being carved into many smaller ones, early in the 19th century, many people continued to call the region Old Bourbon. Located within Old Bourbon was the principal port on the Ohio River, Maysville, Kentucky, from which whiskey and other products were shipped. \\"Old Bourbon\\" was stencilled on the barrels to indicate their port of origin. Old Bourbon whiskey was different because it was the first corn whiskey most people had ever tasted. In time, bourbon became the name for any corn-based whiskey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough many distilleries operated in Bourbon County historically, there were no distilleries operating there between 1919, when Prohibition began in Kentucky, and late 2014, when a small distillery opened \u2013 a period of 95 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nA refinement often dubiously credited to James C. Crow was the sour mash process, by which each new fermentation is conditioned with some amount of spent mash. Spent mash is also known as spent beer, distillers\' spent grain, stillage, and slop or feed mash, so named because it is used as animal feed. The acid introduced by using the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the whiskey and creates a proper pH balance for the yeast to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nA concurrent resolution adopted by the United States Congress in 1964 declared bourbon to be a \\"distinctive product of the United States\\" and asked \\"the appropriate agencies of the United States Government... [to] take appropriate action to prohibit importation into the United States of whiskey designated as \'Bourbon Whiskey.\'\\" Federal regulation now defines \\"bourbon whiskey\\" to only include \\"bourbon\\" produced in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, bourbon and Tennessee whiskey (which is sometimes regarded as a different type of spirit but which generally meets the legal requirements for being called bourbon) have enjoyed significant growth and popularity. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the industry trade group, tracks sales of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Distilled Spirits Council, during 2009\u201314, the volume of 9-liter cases of whiskey increased by 28.5 overall. Higher-end bourbon and whiskeys experienced the greatest growth: during 2009\u201314 the volume of the value segment increased by 12.1, premium by 25.8, high-end premium by 27.8 and super-premium by 123.8. Gross supplier revenues (including federal excise tax) for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased by 46.7 over the 2009\u201314 period, with the greatest growth coming from high-end products (18.7 growth for value, 33.6 for premium, 44.5 for high-end premium, and 137.2 for super-premium).[4] In 2014, more than 19 million nine-liter cases of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were sold in the U.S., generating almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue. U.S. exports of bourbon whiskey surpassed $1 billion for the first time in 2013; distillers hailed the rise of a \\"golden age of Kentucky bourbon\\" and predicted further growth. In 2014, it was estimated that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion (making up the majority of the U.S. total of $1.6 billion in spirits exports). Major export markets for U.S. spirits are, in descending order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and France. The largest percentage increases in U.S. exports were, in descending order: Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, Israel and United Arab Emirates. Key elements of growth in the markets showing the largest increases have been changes of law, trade agreements, and reductions of tariffs, as well as increased consumer demand for premium-category spirits.","type":"Whiskey","flavour":"grain","country":"United States"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb4b8"},"title":"Tequila","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Tequila.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Tequila-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Tequila-Small.png","abv":"40","alcohol":"Yes","description":"Tequila (Spanish pronunciation: [te\u02c8kila] (About this sound listen)) is a regionally specific distilled beverage and type of alcoholic drink made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in the highlands (Los Altos) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Aside from differences in region of origin, tequila is a type of mezcal (and the regions of production of the two drinks are overlapping). The distinction in the method of production is that tequila must use only blue agave plants rather than any type of agave. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime across the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red volcanic soil in the region around the city of Tequila is particularly well suited to the growing of the blue agave, and more than 300 million of the plants are harvested there each year. Agave grows differently depending on the region. Blue agaves grown in the highlands Los Altos region are larger in size and sweeter in aroma and taste. Agaves harvested in the lowlands, on the other hand, have a more herbaceous fragrance and flavour.\\r\\n\\r\\nMexican laws state that tequila can only be produced in the state of Jalisco and limited municipalities in the states of Guanajuato, Michoac\xe1n, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas.

Traditionally, vodka is made by the distillation of fermented cereal grains or potatoes, though some modern brands use other substances, such as fruits or sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1890s, the standard Polish, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Czech vodkas are 40 alcohol by volume abv (80 US proof), a percentage that is widely misattributed to Dmitri Mendeleev. The European Union has established a minimum of 37.5 abv for any \\"European vodka\\" to be named as such. Products sold as \\"vodka\\" in the United States must have a minimum alcohol content of 40. Even with these loose restrictions, most vodka sold contains 40 abv. For homemade vodkas and distilled beverages referred to as \\"moonshine\\", see moonshine by country.\\r\\n\\r\\nVodka is traditionally drunk neat (not mixed with any water, ice, or other mixer), though it is often served chilled in the vodka belt countries (Belarus, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Ukraine). It is also commonly used in cocktails and mixed drinks, such as the vodka martini, Cosmopolitan, vodka tonic, Screwdriver, Greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow Mule, and Bloody Mary.\\r\\n\\r\\nScholars debate the beginnings of vodka. It is a contentious issue because very little historical material is available. For many centuries, beverages differed significantly compared to the vodka of today, as the spirit at that time had a different flavour, color and smell, and was originally used as medicine. It contained little alcohol, an estimated maximum of about 14, as only this amount can be attained by natural fermentation. The still, allowing for distillation (\\"burning of wine\\"), increased purity, and increased alcohol content, was invented in the 8th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common property of the vodkas produced in the United States and Europe is the extensive use of filtration prior to any additional processing including the addition of flavourants. Filtering is sometimes done in the still during distillation, as well as afterwards, where the distilled vodka is filtered through activated charcoal and other media to absorb trace amounts of substances that alter or impart off-flavours to the vodka. However, this is not the case in the traditional vodka-producing nations, so many distillers from these countries prefer to use very accurate distillation but minimal filtering, thus preserving the unique flavours and characteristics of their products.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe master distiller is in charge of distilling the vodka and directing its filtration, which includes the removal of the \\"fore-shots\\", \\"heads\\" and \\"tails\\". These components of the distillate contain flavour compounds such as ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate (heads) as well as the fusel oils (tails) that impact the usually desired clean taste of vodka. Through numerous rounds of distillation, or the use of a fractioning still, the taste is modified and clarity is increased. In contrast, distillery process for liquors such as whiskey, rum, and baijiu allow portions of the \\"heads\\" and \\"tails\\" to remain, giving them their unique flavours.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepeated distillation of vodka will make its ethanol level much higher than is acceptable to most end users, whether legislation determines strength limits or not. Depending on the distillation method and the technique of the stillmaster, the final filtered and distilled vodka may have as much as 95\u201396 ethanol. As such, most vodka is diluted with water prior to bottling.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolish distilleries make a very pure (96, 192 proof, formerly also 98) rectified spirit (Polish language: spirytus rektyfikowany). Technically a form of vodka, it is sold in liquor stores rather than pharmacies. Similarly, the German market often carries German, Hungarian, Polish, and Ukrainian-made varieties of vodka of 90 to 95 abv. A Bulgarian vodka, Balkan 176\xb0, has an 88 alcohol content.

Rum is also produced in Scotland, Austria, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, the Philippines, India, Reunion Island, Mauritius, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, the United States, and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nRums are produced in various grades.

Development of fermented drinks produced from sugarcane juice is believed to have first occurred either in ancient India or in China, and to have spread from there. An example of such an early drink is brum. Produced by the Malay people, brum dates back thousands of years.

Later, distillation of these alcoholic byproducts concentrated the alcohol and removed impurities, producing the first true rums. Tradition suggests rum first originated on the island of Barbados.

Sherry is produced in a variety of styles made primarily from the Palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as Manzanilla and Fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as Amontillado and Oloroso. Sweet dessert wines are also made from Pedro Ximenez or Moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with Palomino-based Sherries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"Sherry\\" is an anglicisation of Xeres (Jerez). Sherry was previously known as sack, from the Spanish saca, meaning \\"extraction\\" from the solera. In Europe, \\"Sherry\\" has protected designation of origin status, and under Spanish law, all wine labelled as \\"Sherry\\" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, an area in the province of C\xe1diz between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanl\xfacar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Mar\xeda. In 1933 the Jerez Denominaci\xf3n de Origen was the first Spanish denominaci\xf3n to be officially recognised in this way, officially named D.O. Jerez-Xeres-Sherry and sharing the same governing council as D.O. Manzanilla Sanl\xfacar de Barrameda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter fermentation is complete, the base wines are fortified with grape spirit in order to increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of flor\u2014a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nWines from different years are aged and blended using a solera system before bottling, so that bottles of sherry will not usually carry a specific vintage year and can contain a small proportion of very old wine.

Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavour. Cow\'s milk is commonly available worldwide, and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally. Milk used may be homogenized or not (milk distributed in many parts of the world is homogenized); both types may be used, with substantially different results.\\r\\n\\r\\nYogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are also sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt. Some countries require yogurt to contain a certain amount of colony-forming units of bacteria; in China, for example, the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 \xd7 106 CFU per milliliter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo produce yogurt, milk is first heated, usually to about 85 \xb0C (185 \xb0F), to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds.

The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a temperature of 45 \xb0C (113 \xb0F) is maintained for four to twelve hours to allow fermentation.","type":"Cream","flavour":"preserves","country":"United States"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb4d9"},"title":"Mango","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Mango.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Mango-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Mango-Small.png","abv":"0","alcohol":"No","description":"A mango is a juicy stone fruit (drupe) produced from numerous species of tropical trees belonging to the flowering plant genus Mangifera, cultivated mostly for their edible fruit.

Its taste is similar to other anise liquors like pastis, sambuca, arak, rak\u0131, and mastika, that are traditionally produced and consumed in Mediterranean countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nOuzo has its roots in tsipouro, which is said to have been the work of a group of 14th-century monks on Mount Athos. One version of it was flavoured with anise. This version eventually came to be called ouzo.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern ouzo distillation largely took off in the beginning of the 19th century following Greek independence. The first ouzo distillery was founded in Tyrnavos in 1856 by Nikolaos Katsaros, giving birth to the famous ouzo Tyrnavou. When absinthe fell into disfavour in the early 20th century, ouzo was one of the products whose popularity rose to fill the gap; it was once called \\"a substitute for absinthe without the wormwood\\".[2] In 1932, ouzo producers developed a method of distillation using copper stills that is now the standard method of production. One of the largest producers of ouzo today is Varvayiannis (\u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2),[citation needed] located in the town of Plomari in the southeast portion of the island of Lesbos, while in the same town Pitsiladi (\u03a0\u03b9\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03b4\u03ae), a variety of high-quality ouzo, is also distilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nOuzo is traditionally mixed with water, becoming cloudy white, sometimes with a faint blue tinge, and served with ice cubes in a small glass. Ouzo can also be drunk straight from a shot glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nOuzo is traditionally served with a small plate of a variety of appetizers called mezes, usually small fresh fish, fries, olives and feta cheese. Ouzo can be described to have a similar taste to absinthe which is liquorice-like, but smoother.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 25, 2006, Greece won the right to label ouzo as an exclusively Greek product. The European Union now recognizes ouzo, as well as the Greek drinks tsipouro and tsikoudia, as products with a Protected Designation of Origin, which prohibits European makers other than Greece and Cyprus from using the name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an ouzo museum in Plomari, Lesvos.","type":"Aperitif","flavour":"preserves the original appearance of the drink","country":"Greece"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb4e7"},"title":"Coffee","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Coffee.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Coffee-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Coffee-Small.png","abv":"0","alcohol":"No","description":"Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and R\xe9union in the Indian Ocean. The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavour. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, cafe latte, etc.). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is also served. Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption inhibits cognitive decline during aging or lowers the risk of some forms of cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee seeds were first exported from East Africa to Yemen, as the coffea arabica plant is thought to have been indigenous to the former. Yemeni traders took coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the seed. By the 16th century, it had reached Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. From there, it spread to Europe and the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffee is a major export commodity: it is the top agricultural export for numerous countries and is among the world\'s largest legal agricultural exports. It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Some controversy is associated with coffee cultivation and the way developed countries trade with developing nations and the impact of its cultivation on the environment, in regards to clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.

Its chemical formula is H2O, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds. Strictly speaking, water refers to the liquid state of a substance that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater covers 71 of the Earth\'s surface.[1] It is vital for all known forms of life. On Earth, 96.5 of the planet\'s crust water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7 in groundwater, 1.7 in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, 0.001 in the air as vapor, clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation. Only 2.5 of this water is freshwater, and 98.8 of that water is in ice (excepting ice in clouds) and groundwater. Less than 0.3 of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earth\'s freshwater (0.003) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products. A greater quantity of water is found in the earth\'s interior.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater on Earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea. Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land. Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated minerals.\\r\\n\\r\\nSafe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation. There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and gross domestic product per capita. However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability. A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50.\\r\\n\\r\\nWater plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70 of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture. Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world. Much of long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil and natural gas) and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing. Water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, and diving.","type":"Water","flavour":"Water","country":"United States"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb4ea"},"title":"Espresso","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Espresso.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Espresso-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Espresso-Small.png","abv":"0","alcohol":"No","description":"Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage that is brewed by forcing hot water under pressure through finely-ground coffee.

It may be pale, golden, amber, or dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough one of the most defining features of lager is its maturation in cold storage, it is also distinguished by the use of a specific yeast. While it is possible to use lager yeast in a warm fermentation process, such as with American steam beer, the lack of a cold storage maturation phase precludes such beer from being classified as lager. On the other hand, German Altbier and K\xf6lsch, brewed with a top-fermenting yeast at a warm temperature, but with a cold storage finishing stage, are classified as oberg\xe4riges Lagerbier (top-fermented lager beer).\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 19th century, the German word Lagerbier (de) referred to all types of \\"bottom-fermented\\", cool-conditioned beer, in normal strengths.

Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word whisky (or whiskey) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce (or uisge) meaning \\"water\\" (now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic, and uisge in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae (\\"water of life\\"). This was translated to Classical Gaelic as Irish: uisce beatha/Scottish Gaelic: uisge beatha \\"water of life\\". Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe (1581), usquebaugh (1610), usquebath (1621), and usquebae (1715).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being distilled, but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence. The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD, but these were not distillations of alcohol. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again these were not distillations of alcohol. Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century. The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century, where alcohol was distilled from wine. An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull (1232 \u2013 1315). Its use spread through medieval monasteries, largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of colic and smallpox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe art of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no later than the 15th century, as did the common European practice of distilling \\"aqua vitae\\" or spirit alcohol primarily for medicinal purposes. The practice of medicinal distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Barber Surgeons. The earliest Irish mention of whisky comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to \\"taking a surfeit of aqua vitae\\" at Christmas. In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent \\"To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae\\", enough to make about 500 bottles.\\r\\n\\r\\nA still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant to drink. Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nColumn stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40\u201350 alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.","type":"Whisky","flavour":"sugar","country":"Scotland"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb4fb"},"title":"Absolut Citron","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Absolut_Citron.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Absolut_Citron-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Absolut_Citron-Small.png","abv":"40","alcohol":"Yes","description":"Absolut Vodka is a brand of vodka, produced near \xc5hus, in southern Sweden.

Historically, the term referred to a drink brewed without hops.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with most beers, ale typically has a bittering agent to balance the sweetness of the malt and act as a preservative. Ale was originally bittered with gruit, a mixture of herbs or spices boiled in the wort before fermentation. Later, hops replaced gruit as the bittering agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAle, along with bread, was an important source of nutrition in the medieval world, particularly small beer, also known as table beer or mild beer, which was highly nutritious, contained just enough alcohol to act as a preservative, and provided hydration without intoxicating effects. Small beer would have been consumed daily by almost everyone, including children, in the medieval world, with higher-alcohol ales served for recreational purposes. The lower cost for proprietors combined with the lower taxes levied on small beer led to the selling of beer labeled \\"strong beer\\" that had actually been diluted with small beer. In medieval times, ale may have been safer to drink than most water (the germ theory of disease was unheard of, and the sterilizing properties of boiling unknown); however, there is no period evidence that people were aware of this nor that they chose to drink ale for this reason. The alcohol, hops, and some ingredients in gruit used to preserve some ales may have contributed to their lower load of pathogens, when compared to water. However, ale was largely safer due to the hours of boiling required in production, not the alcoholic content of the finished beverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrewing ale in the Middle Ages was a local industry primarily pursued by women. Brewsters, or alewives, would brew in the home for both domestic consumption and small scale commercial sale. Brewsters provided a substantial supplemental income for families; however, only in select few cases, as was the case for widows, was brewing considered the primary income of the household.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word ale is related to the Old English alu or ealu, aloth and ealoth in the genitive and dative.

Cider is also popular in other European countries including Ireland, Portugal (mainly in Minho and Madeira), France (in particular Brittany and Normandy), northern Italy (Piedmont and Friuli), and Spain (especially Asturias and the Basque Country). Central Europe also has its own types of cider with Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse producing a particularly tart version known as Apfelwein.\\r\\n\\r\\nCider alcohol content varies from 1.2 abv to 8.5 or more in traditional English ciders, and 3.5 to 12 in continental ciders. In UK law, it must contain at least 35 apple juice (fresh or from concentrate), although CAMRA says that \\"real cider\\" must be at least 90 fresh apple juice. In the US, there is a 50 minimum. In France, cider must be made solely from apples. In 2014, a study found that a pint of mass-market cider contained five teaspoons (20.5 g) of sugar, nearly as much as the WHO recommends as an adult\'s daily allowance of added sugar, and 5\u201310 times the amount of sugar in lager or ale.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerry is a similar product made from fermented pear juice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flavour of cider varies. Ciders can be classified from dry to sweet. Their appearance ranges from cloudy with sediment to completely clear, and their colour ranges from almost clear to amber to brown. The variations in clarity and colour are mostly due to filtering between pressing and fermentation. Some apple varieties will produce a clear cider without any need for filtration. Both sparkling and still ciders are made; the sparkling variety is the more common.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern, mass-produced ciders closely resemble sparkling wine in appearance. More traditional brands tend to be darker and cloudier. They are often stronger than the mass-produced varieties and taste more strongly of apples. Almost colourless, white cider has the same apple juice content as conventional cider but is harder to create because the cider maker has to blend various apples to create a clearer liquid. White ciders tend to be sweeter and more refreshing. They are typically 7-8  abv in strength. Black cider, by contrast, is dry amber premium cider which has an alcohol content of 7-8  abv. The descriptor black usually comes after the brand name such as Union Black and Barnstormer Black.","type":"Cider","flavour":"White","country":"United Kingdom"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb503"},"title":"Sprite","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Sprite.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Sprite-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Sprite-Small.png","abv":"0","alcohol":"No","description":"Sprite is a popular lemon-lime flavoured soft drink.

The rights to the brand are held by Dr Pepper Snapple Group in the United States, and PepsiCo (or its licensees) in the rest of the world. The U.S. version of the 7 Up logo includes a red cherry between the \\"7\\" and \\"Up\\"; this red cherry has been animated and used as a mascot for the brand as Cool Spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n7 Up was created by Charles Leiper Grigg, who launched his St. Louis\u2013based company The Howdy Corporation in 1920.[1] Grigg came up with the formula for a lemon-lime soft drink in 1929. The product, originally named \\"Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda\\", was launched two weeks before the Wall Street Crash of 1929.[2] It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1950.[3] It was one of a number of patent medicine products popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Its name was later shortened to \\"7 Up Lithiated Lemon Soda\\" before being further shortened to just \\"7 Up\\" by 1936.\\r\\n\\r\\nWestinghouse bought 7 Up in 1969 and sold it in 1978 to Philip Morris, who then in 1986 sold it to a group led by the investment firm Hicks & Haas.[4] 7 Up merged with Dr Pepper in 1988; Cadbury Schweppes bought the combined company in 1995. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\n7 Up has been reformulated several times since its launch in 1929. In 2006, the version of the product sold in the U.S. was re-formulated so that it could be marketed as being \\"100 natural\\". This was achieved by eliminating the chelating-agent calcium disodium EDTA, and replacing sodium citrate with potassium citrate in order to reduce the beverage\'s sodium content.[5] This re-formulation contains no fruit juice and, in the U.S., is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The manufacturing process used in the production of HFCS has led some public health and advocacy groups to challenge the ad campaign\'s \\"natural\\" claims.[6] In 2007, after the Center for Science in the Public Interest threatened to sue 7 Up, it was announced that 7 Up would stop being marketed as \\"100 natural\\". Instead, it is now promoted as having \\"100 Natural flavours\\". The controversy does not extend to other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where HFCS is not generally used in foods, including 7 Up. In 2011, 7 Up began test-marketing a formula, called 7 Up Retro, using sugar rather than HFCS. Container labels sport the caption, \\"Made With Real Sugar\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThere exists a myth that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, similar to other drinks of the type.[7] The real origin of the name is unclear,[8] though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink,[9] while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass of approximately 7.","type":"Soft Drink","flavour":"sugar","country":"United States"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64aebb7f82d96cc69e0eb505"},"title":"Blackberry brandy","ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Blackberry_brandy.png","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Blackberry_brandy-Medium.png","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/Blackberry_brandy-Small.png","abv":"40","alcohol":"Yes","description":"Blackberry brandy is a type of fruit brandy that is infused with the flavour of blackberries.

Whipped cream is often sweetened and sometimes flavored with vanilla. Whipped cream is often called Chantilly cream or cr\xe8me Chantilly (pronounced [k\u0281\u025bm \u0283\u0251\u0303tiji]).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhipped cream is an aerated colloid produced when air is incorporated into cream containing at least 35 fat. During whipping, partially coalesced fat molecules create a stabilized network which traps air bubbles. The resulting colloid is roughly double the volume of the original cream. If, however, the whipping is continued, the fat droplets will stick together destroying the colloid and forming butter. Lower-fat cream (or milk) does not whip well, while higher-fat cream produces a more stable foam.\\r\\n\\r\\nCream is usually whipped with a whisk, an electric or hand mixer, or a food processor. Results are best when the equipment and ingredients are cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhipped cream is often flavored with sugar, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, orange, and so on. Many 19th-century recipes recommend adding gum tragacanth to stabilize whipped cream; a few include whipped egg whites. Various other substances, including gelatin and diphosphate (E450), are used in commercial stabilizers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhipped cream may also be made in a whipping siphon, typically using nitrous oxide as the gas, as carbon dioxide tends to give a sour taste.[10] The siphon may have replaceable cartridges or be sold as a pre-pressurized retail package. The gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure, and when the pressure is released, produces bubbles and thus whipped cream.","type":"Cream","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c069d8333cf130fb3d"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Orange juice","description":"","type":"Juice","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c069d8333cf130fb40"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Club soda","description":"","type":"","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c169d8333cf130fb44"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Pisang Ambon","description":"","type":"Liquer","alcohol":"Yes","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c169d8333cf130fb4a"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Beer","description":"Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea.[5] Beer is brewed from cereal grains \u2014 most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of humanity\'s earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeer is distributed in bottles and cans and is also commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4 to 6 alcohol by volume (abv), although it may vary between 0.5 and 20, with some breweries creating examples of 40 abv and above.[11] Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious legal definitions of beer exist in different countries. Historically, the most famous of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government\u2019s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1 to 8.6, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6 and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25 ABV, which means that it has to be 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered \u2018lite\u2019 only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process.[13] In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0 alcohol by volume concentration at 20 \xb0C.

Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as Coleus. Others are grown for seed, such as Salvia hispanica (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as Plectranthus edulis, Plectranthus esculentus, Plectranthus rotundifolius, and Stachys affinis (Chinese artichoke).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family has a cosmopolitan distribution. The enlarged Lamiaceae contains about 236 genera and has been stated to contain 6,900 to 7,200 species, but the World Checklist lists 7,534. The largest genera are Salvia (900), Scutellaria (360), Stachys (300), Plectranthus (300), Hyptis (280), Teucrium (250), Vitex (250), Thymus (220), and Nepeta (200). Clerodendrum was once a genus of over 400 species, but by 2010, it had been narrowed to about 150.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe family has traditionally been considered closely related to the Verbenaceae; in the 1990s, phylogenetic studies suggested that many genera classified in the Verbenaceae should be classified in the Lamiaceae  or to other families in the order Lamiales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alternate family name Labiatae refers to the fact that the flowers typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip (labia in Latin). The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with five united petals and five united sepals. They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate (a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers, but actually consists of two crowded clusters). Although this is still considered an acceptable alternative name, most botanists now use the name Lamiaceae in referring to this family. The leaves emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one (decussate) or whorled. The stems are frequently square in cross section, but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.","type":"Flower","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c269d8333cf130fb61"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Mint syrup","description":"","type":"Syrup","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c269d8333cf130fb65"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Malibu rum","description":"Malibu is a brand of rum, flavored with liqueur, possessing an alcohol content by volume of 21.0 (42 proof).

Also known as aguardente, pinga, caninha and other names, it is the most popular distilled alcoholic beverage in Brazil. Outside Brazil, cacha\xe7a is used almost exclusively as an ingredient in tropical drinks, with the caipirinha being the most famous cocktail.\\r\\n\\r\\nSugar production was mostly switched from the Madeira islands to Brazil by the Portuguese in the 16th century. In Madeira, aguardente de cana is made by distilling sugar cane liquors and the pot stills from Madeira were brought to Brazil to make what today is also called cacha\xe7a.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process dates from 1532, when one of the Portuguese colonisers brought the first cuttings of sugar cane to Brazil from Madeira. Cacha\xe7a is mostly produced in Brazil, where, according to 2007 figures, 1,500,000,000 litres (396,000,000 US gal; 330,000,000 imp gal) are consumed annually, compared with 15,000,000 litres (3,960,000 US gal; 3,300,000 imp gal) outside the country. It is typically between 38 and 48 alcohol by volume. When homemade, it can be as strong as the distiller wants. Up to six grams per litre of sugar may be added.\\r\\n\\r\\nFigures from 2003 indicate 1.3 billion litres of cacha\xe7a are produced each year; only 1 of this is exported (mainly to Germany).\\r\\n\\r\\nCacha\xe7a, like rum, has two varieties: unaged (Portuguese: branca, \\"white\\" or prata, \\"silver\\") and aged (amarela, \\"yellow\\" or ouro, \\"gold\\"). White cacha\xe7a is usually bottled immediately after distillation and tends to be cheaper (some producers age it for up to 12 months in wooden barrels to achieve a smoother blend). It is often used as an ingredient in caipirinha and other beverages. Dark cacha\xe7a, usually seen as the \\"premium\\" variety, is aged in wood barrels and is meant to be drunk straight (it is usually aged for up to 3 years though some \\"ultra premium\\" cacha\xe7as have been aged for up to 15 years). Its flavour is influenced by the type of wood the barrel is made from.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are very important regions in Brazil where fine pot still cacha\xe7a is produced such as Ch\xe3 Grande in Pernambuco state, Salinas in Minas Gerais state, Paraty in Rio de Janeiro state, Monte Alegre do Sul in S\xe3o Paulo state and Aba\xedra in Bahia state. Nowadays, producers of cacha\xe7a can be found in most Brazilian regions and in 2011 there were over 40,000 of them.","type":"Spirit","alcohol":"Yes","abv":"","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c469d8333cf130fb85"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Pineapple Syrup","description":"Pineapple syrup is a kind of simple syrup that takes advantage of pineapple\'s texturizing effect to produce a sweet-and-sour, musky syrup that is not only a classic Tiki ingredient, but also has uses in many early 20th century cocktails.

It is typically used for flavouring beverages or (less often) food. The bitters were first produced in the town of Angostura (Ciudad Bol\xedvar, Venezuela) (hence the name), but do not contain angostura bark. The bottle is easily recognisable by its distinctive oversized label.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recipe was developed as a tonic by a German, Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert (1796\u20131870), surgeon general in Sim\xf3n Bol\xedvar\'s army in Venezuela. Siegert began to sell it in 1824 and established a distillery for the purpose in 1830. Siegert was based in the town of Angostura, now Ciudad Bol\xedvar, and used locally available ingredients, perhaps aided by botanical knowledge of the local Amerindians. The product was sold abroad from 1853, and in 1875 the plant was moved from Ciudad Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it remains. Angostura won a medal at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien. The medal is still depicted on the oversized label, along with reverse which shows Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact formula is a closely guarded secret, with only one person knowing the whole recipe, passed hereditarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngostura bitters are extremely concentrated and are an acquired taste; though 44.7 alcohol by volume, bitters are not normally ingested undiluted, but instead are used in small amounts as flavouring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngostura bitters are a key ingredient in many cocktails. Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in the Sim\xf3n Bol\xedvar army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with gin. The mix stuck in the form of a pink gin, and is also used in many other alcoholic cocktails such as long vodka, consisting of vodka, Angostura bitters, and lemonade. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: the Old Fashioned, made with whiskey, bitters, sugar, and water,[8] and the Manhattan, made usually with rye whiskey and sweet vermouth. In a Pisco Sour a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a Champagne Cocktail a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local Gunner cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the Mojito cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in \\"soft\\" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is lemon lime and bitters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngostura Bitters Drink Guide, a promotional booklet of 1908, was reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.","type":"Bitter","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c469d8333cf130fb8e"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Pepper","description":"","type":"","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c469d8333cf130fb91"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Lavender","description":"Lavandula is a genus of 47 known species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae.

While vermouth was traditionally used for medicinal purposes, its true claim to fame is as an aperitif, with fashionable cafes in Turin serving it to guests around the clock. However, in the late 19th century it became popular with bartenders as a key ingredient in many classic cocktails that have survived to date, such as the Martini, the Manhattan, the Rob Roy, and the Negroni. In addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as an alternative white wine in cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, there have been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth manufacturers have created additional styles, including extra-dry white, sweet white (bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and ros\xe9. Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit or spirit only \u2013 which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style.

It is produced in Lynchburg, Tennessee, by the Jack Daniel Distillery, which has been owned by the Brown-Forman Corporation since 1956. Despite being the location of a major operational distillery, Jack Daniel\'s home county of Moore is a dry county, so the product is not available for purchase at stores or restaurants within the county.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe product meets the regulatory criteria for classification as a straight bourbon, though the company disavows this classification and markets it simply as Tennessee whiskey rather than as Tennessee bourbon. Jack Daniel\'s distillery tour advises that their product is initially bourbon prior to entering their charcoal filtering setup, and that this process creates the distinction between regular bourbon and \\"Tennessee sipping whiskey.\\" As defined in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Tennessee Whiskey is classified as a straight bourbon authorized to be produced in the state of Tennessee. Packaged in square bottles, a total of 11 million cases of the flagship \\"Black Label\\" product were sold in the company\'s 2012 fiscal year, which ended April 30, 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mash for Jack Daniel\'s is made from corn, rye, and malted barley, and is distilled in copper stills. It is then filtered through 10-foot (3.0 m) stacks of sugar maple charcoal. The company refers to this filtering step as \\"mellowing\\". This extra step, known as the Lincoln County Process, removes impurities and the taste of corn. The company argues this extra step makes the product different from bourbon. However, Tennessee whiskey is required to be \\"a straight Bourbon Whiskey\\" under terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement and Canadian law. A distinctive aspect of the filtering process is that the Jack Daniel\'s brand grinds its charcoal before using it for filtering. After the filtering, the whiskey is stored in newly handcrafted oak barrels, which give the whiskey its color and most of its flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe product label mentions that it is a \\"sour mash\\" whiskey, which means that when the mash is prepared, some of the wet solids from a previously used batch are mixed in to help make the fermentation process operate more consistently. This is common practice in American whiskey production. (As of 2005, all currently produced straight bourbon is produced using the sour mash process.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being used for the aging of Jack Daniel\'s whiskey, many barrels go to Scotland to be used in the production of Scotch whisky. Some barrels are leased from Glenmorangie distillery. Some of the barrels are sold to McIlhenny Company of Avery Island, Louisiana, for production of Tabasco sauce and to both the Mount Gay Rum company of Barbados and Appleton Estate of Jamaica for use in the aging process of their distinctively flavored rums.] Some barrels are also cut in half and shipped to Lowe\'s Home Centers to be used as planter pots. They retain the whiskey smell for some time after arriving there and must be watered every couple of days to keep them intact[clarification needed] before they are sold and filled with soil.","type":"Whiskey","alcohol":"Yes","abv":"","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c769d8333cf130fbc5"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Jim Beam","description":"","type":"Whiskey","alcohol":"Yes","abv":"","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5c769d8333cf130fbc9"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Coca-Cola","description":"Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink[1] produced by The Coca-Cola Company.

It was sold at a lower price than the monopoly\'s product, just outside the city border. Smith even offered free boat rides to the distillery and \\"Rent Br\xe4nnvin\\" made Smith a fortune.\\n\\nIn 1917, the alcohol industry in Sweden was monopolized by the Swedish government. Vodka was then sold nationwide under the name \\"Absolut Rent Br\xe4nnvin\\". The name changed with intervals, Renat Br\xe4nnvin or Absolut Rent Br\xe4nnvin. In 1979, the old name Absolut was picked up when the upper-price range ABSOLUT VODKA was introduced. Renat is still a euphemism for spirits in Sweden, and the name of another vodka product by Vin & Sprit.\\n\\n\\nAbsolut Vodka was introduced to the global market in 1979. Since its launch, Absolut has grown from 90,000 liters to 96.6 million liters in 2008. It has become the largest international spirit and is available in 126 countries. The vodka is made from winter wheat. Approximately 80,000 metric tons (2,900,000 bushels) of wheat are used annually to produce Absolut Vodka.

It is commonly referred to in historical literature as \\"la f\xe9e verte\\" (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit.[6] Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbsinthe originated in the canton of Neuch\xe2tel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. Owing in part to its association with bohemian culture, the consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists. Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Byron and Alfred Jarry were all known absinthe drinkers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbsinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, although present in the spirit in only trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria-Hungary. Although absinthe was vilified, it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe\'s psychoactive properties (apart from that of the alcohol) have been exaggerated. A revival of absinthe began in the 1990s, following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws that removed longstanding barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Australia, Spain, and the Czech Republic.","type":"Spirit","alcohol":"Yes","abv":" 45\u201374 ABV / 90\u2013148 U.S. proof","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5d169d8333cf130fc75"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Aperol","description":" Aperol is an Italian ap\xe9ritif made of bitter orange, gentian, rhubarb, and cinchona among other ingredients.

Guinness, produced by the Diageo beverages company, is one of the most successful beer brands worldwide. It is brewed in almost 50 countries and is available in over 120. Annual sales total of Guinness in 2011 was 850 million litres (220,000,000 US gal).\\r\\n\\r\\nGuinness features a burnt flavour that is derived from malted barley and roasted unmalted barley. The use of roasted barley is a relatively modern development, not becoming part of the grist until the mid-20th century. For many years, a portion of aged brew was blended with freshly brewed beer to give a sharp lactic flavour. Although Guinness\'s palate still features a characteristic \\"tang\\", the company has refused to confirm whether this type of blending still occurs. The draught beer\'s thick, creamy head comes from mixing the beer with nitrogen and carbon dioxide when poured. It is popular with the Irish, both in Ireland and abroad. In spite of declining consumption since 2001, it is still the best-selling alcoholic drink in Ireland where Guinness & Co.

It is typically used for flavouring beverages or (less often) food. The bitters were first produced in the town of Angostura (Ciudad Bol\xedvar, Venezuela) (hence the name), but do not contain angostura bark. The bottle is easily recognisable by its distinctive oversized label.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recipe was developed as a tonic by a German, Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert (1796\u20131870), surgeon general in Sim\xf3n Bol\xedvar\'s army in Venezuela. Siegert began to sell it in 1824 and established a distillery for the purpose in 1830. Siegert was based in the town of Angostura, now Ciudad Bol\xedvar, and used locally available ingredients, perhaps aided by botanical knowledge of the local Amerindians. The product was sold abroad from 1853, and in 1875 the plant was moved from Ciudad Bolivar to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where it remains. Angostura won a medal at the Weltausstellung 1873 Wien. The medal is still depicted on the oversized label, along with reverse which shows Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact formula is a closely guarded secret, with only one person knowing the whole recipe, passed hereditarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngostura bitters are extremely concentrated and are an acquired taste; though 44.7 alcohol by volume, bitters are not normally ingested undiluted, but instead are used in small amounts as flavouring.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngostura bitters are a key ingredient in many cocktails. Originally used to help with upset stomachs of the soldiers in the Sim\xf3n Bol\xedvar army, it later became popular in soda water and was usually served with gin. The mix stuck in the form of a pink gin, and is also used in many other alcoholic cocktails such as long vodka, consisting of vodka, Angostura bitters, and lemonade. In the United States, it is best known for its use in whiskey cocktails: the Old Fashioned, made with whiskey, bitters, sugar, and water,[8] and the Manhattan, made usually with rye whiskey and sweet vermouth. In a Pisco Sour a few drops are sprinkled on top of the foam, both for aroma and decoration. In a Champagne Cocktail a few drops of bitters are added to a sugar cube.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hong Kong, Angostura bitters are included in the local Gunner cocktail. Though not in the classic recipe, bartenders sometimes add more flavour to the Mojito cocktail by sprinkling a few drops of Angostura bitters on top. Bitters can also be used in \\"soft\\" drinks; a common drink served in Australian and New Zealand pubs is lemon lime and bitters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAngostura Bitters Drink Guide, a promotional booklet of 1908, was reprinted in 2008 with a new introduction by Ross Bolton.","type":"Bitter","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5d269d8333cf130fc95"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Tennessee whiskey","description":" Tennessee whiskey is a type of whiskey that is produced in the U.S. state of Tennessee.

When the clear liqueur is diluted with water, the oils cloud the liqueur, a phenomenon known as the ouzo effect. This same effect occurs with absinthe and similar drinks. The oils solidify when cold water is added and the liqueur may turn cloudy or \\"milky\\". This is because the anethole in the anise remains in solution above its melting point of 21 \xb0C. Anethole is only slightly soluble in water but highly soluble in ethanol.

Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater, where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2 oz) of solids per litre, a salinity of 3.5.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt is essential for life in general, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes. The tissues of animals contain larger quantities of salt than do plant tissues. Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period. Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6 is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.\\r\\n\\r\\nSodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute. Excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, in children and adults. Such health effects of salt have long been studied. Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. The World Health Organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day.","type":"Mineral","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5d969d8333cf130fd0a"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Fruit juice","description":" Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables.

Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg\'s water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20 of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch.

Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and elderberry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWine has been produced for thousands of years.

Agave syrup is sweeter than honey and tends to be less viscous. Most agave syrup comes from Mexico and South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo produce agave syrup from the Agave americana and A. tequilana plants, the leaves are cut off the plant after it has been growing for seven to fourteen years. The juice is then extracted from the core of the agave, called the pi\xf1a. The juice is filtered, then heated to break the complex components (the polysaccharides) into simple sugars.[citation needed] The main polysaccharide is called inulin or fructosan and is mostly fructose. This filtered juice is then concentrated to a syrupy liquid, slightly thinner than honey. Its color varies from light- to dark-amber, depending on the degree of processing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgave salmiana is processed differently from Agave tequiliana. As the plant develops, it starts to grow a stalk called a quiote. The stalk is cut off before it fully grows, creating a hole in the center of the plant that fills with a liquid called aguamiel. The liquid is collected daily. The liquid is then heated, breaking down its complex components into fructose and glucose and preventing it from fermenting into pulque.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative method used to process the agave juice without heat is described in a United States patent for a process that uses enzymes derived from the mold Aspergillus niger to convert the inulin-rich extract into fructose.

Laraha is a bitter orange native of Cura\xe7ao with the Latin name: \\"Citrus Aurantium Currasuviensis\\", meaning \\"Golden Orange of Cura\xe7ao\\". Spanish explorers brought the sweet Valencia orange to the island in 1527, [2] but the nutrient-poor soil and arid climate of Cura\xe7ao proved unsuitable to Valencia cultivation, resulting in small, bitter fruit. Although the bitter flesh of the Laraha is hardly edible, the peels are aromatic and flavorful, maintaining much of the essence of the Valencia orange.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no definite facts that points out who and when the first Cura\xe7ao Liqueur was developed. The Lucas Bols distillery, founded in 1575 in Amsterdam, maintains that Lucas Bols (1652\u20131719) already developed a Laraha-based liqueur. The Dutch West Indies Company had taken possession of Cura\xe7ao in 1634 and Bols had shares in both the West and East India Companies to guarantee the cheap supply of spices for their distilled drinks. After the discovery that an aromatic oil could be extracted from the unripe peel of the otherwise useless bitter oranges, Bols had this oil exported back to Amsterdam to develop a liqueur similar to current day Cura\xe7ao. Bols tended to add an \\"element of alchemical mystery\\" to his products, explaining the unlikely addition of a blue coloring. In the past, the liqueur also had the name Cr\xe8me de Ciel (\\"cream of heaven\\"), presumably for its blue color.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, the Senior & Co, a company that originates from Cura\xe7ao, are to this day the only company that always produced their liqueur with the peels of the Laraha. The Jewish family, Senior and Chumacairo, started selling their liqueur in 1896 in their pharmacy at small quantities. In 1947 they bought the Landhuis (Dutch for \\"country manor\\") Chobolobo in Willemstad, where the distillery has since been housed.

Various grains (which may be malted) are used for different varieties, including barley, corn (maize), rye, and wheat. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, generally made of charred white oak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types. The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word whisky (or whiskey) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce (or uisge) meaning \\"water\\" (now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic, and uisge in Scottish Gaelic). Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae (\\"water of life\\"). This was translated to Classical Gaelic as Irish: uisce beatha/Scottish Gaelic: uisge beatha \\"water of life\\". Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe (1581), usquebaugh (1610), usquebath (1621), and usquebae (1715).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC, with perfumes and aromatics being distilled, but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence. The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD, but these were not distillations of alcohol. The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks, and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century, but again these were not distillations of alcohol. Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins, with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century. The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century, where alcohol was distilled from wine. An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull (1232 \u2013 1315). Its use spread through medieval monasteries, largely for medicinal purposes, such as the treatment of colic and smallpox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe art of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no later than the 15th century, as did the common European practice of distilling \\"aqua vitae\\" or spirit alcohol primarily for medicinal purposes. The practice of medicinal distillation eventually passed from a monastic setting to the secular via professional medical practitioners of the time, The Guild of Barber Surgeons. The earliest Irish mention of whisky comes from the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise, which attributes the death of a chieftain in 1405 to \\"taking a surfeit of aqua vitae\\" at Christmas. In Scotland, the first evidence of whisky production comes from an entry in the Exchequer Rolls for 1494 where malt is sent \\"To Friar John Cor, by order of the king, to make aquavitae\\", enough to make about 500 bottles.\\r\\n\\r\\nA still for making whisky is usually made of copper, since it removes sulfur-based compounds from the alcohol that would make it unpleasant to drink. Modern stills are made of stainless steel with copper innards (piping, for example, will be lined with copper along with copper plate inlays along still walls). The simplest standard distillation apparatus is commonly known as a pot still, consisting of a single heated chamber and a vessel to collect purified alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nColumn stills are frequently used in the production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still in the production of bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40\u201350 alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.","type":"Whisky","alcohol":"Yes","abv":"40","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d5f269d8333cf130fe45"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Carbonated soft drink","description":" A soft drink (also called soda, pop, coke, soda pop, fizzy drink, tonic, mineral or carbonated beverage) is a beverage that typically contains carbonated water, a sweetener, and a natural or artificial flavoring.

As the drink became better known, Ross registered the name as a trademark in 1893.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ross died, his widow, Eleanor, was obliged to sell the recipe to pay for their children\'s education; by coincidence to a different MacKinnon family.

The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species \u2013 Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa \xd7 paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata \xd7 M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name for this hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer used.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea. They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine and banana beer and as ornamental plants. The world\'s largest producers of bananas in 2017 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 38 of total production. Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between \\"bananas\\" and \\"plantains\\". Especially in the Americas and Europe, \\"banana\\" usually refers to soft, sweet, dessert bananas, particularly those of the Cavendish group, which are the main exports from banana-growing countries. By contrast, Musa cultivars with firmer, starchier fruit are called \\"plantains\\". In other regions, such as Southeast Asia, many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten, so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages.","type":" Fruit","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d60169d8333cf130ff13"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Pepsi Cola","description":"A popular carbonated cola beverage, known for its sweet and caramel-like flavor.","type":"Cola","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"","country":""},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d60169d8333cf130ff1a"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Banana liqueur","description":" Banana liqueur is an alcoholic liqueur flavored with banana, either artificially or with real banana juice.

It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale \\"onion-skin\\" orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the grape varieties used and winemaking techniques. Usually, the wine is labelled ros\xe9 in French, Portuguese, and English-speaking countries, rosado in Spanish, or rosato in Italian.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three major ways to produce ros\xe9 wine: skin contact, saign\xe9e, and blending. Ros\xe9 wines can be made still, semi-sparkling or sparkling and with a wide range of sweetness levels from highly dry Proven\xe7al ros\xe9 to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Ros\xe9 wines are made from a wide variety of grapes and can be found all around the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen ros\xe9 wine is the primary product, it is produced with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the skins are allowed to remain in contact with the juice for a short period, typically two to twenty hours.[3] The grape must is then pressed and the skins discarded, rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer the skins are left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a winemaker desires to impart more tannin and color to red wine, some of the pink juice from the must can be removed at an early stage in what is known as the Saign\xe9e (from French bleeding) method. The red wine remaining in the vats is intensified as a result of the bleeding, because the volume of juice in the must is reduced, and the must involved in the maceration becomes more concentrated. The pink juice that is removed can be fermented separately to produce ros\xe9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simple mixing of red wine into white wine to impart color is uncommon and is discouraged in most wine growing regions, especially in France, where it is forbidden by law, except for Champagne. Even in Champagne, several high-end producers do not use this method but rather the saign\xe9e method.","type":"Wine","alcohol":"Yes","abv":"14"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d60269d8333cf130ff2d"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Cranberry vodka","description":" Vodka (Polish: w\xf3dka, Russian: \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430) is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and ethanol, sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings.

Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and elderberry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest known traces of wine are from China (c.\u20097000 BC), Georgia (c.\u20096000 BC), Iran (c.\u20095000 BC), and Sicily (c.\u20094000 BC). The earliest known winery is the 6,100-year-old Areni-1 winery in Armenia. Wine reached the Balkans by 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece, Thrace and Rome. Throughout history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nWine has long played an important role in religion.

The gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure, and when the pressure is released, produces bubbles and thus whipped cream.","type":"Cream","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"Sweet","country":"Global"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d62169d8333cf13100db"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Yukon Jack","description":"Yukon Jack is a liqueur advertised as the \\"Black sheep of Canadian Liquors\\".

It is a creeping vine that bears cucumiform fruits that are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber: slicing, pickling, and seedless. Within these varieties, several cultivars have been created. In North America, the term \\"wild cucumber\\" refers to plants in the genera Echinocystis and Marah, but these are not closely related. The cucumber is originally from South Asia, but now grows on most continents. Many different types of cucumber are traded on the global market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium and will sprawl along the ground if it does not have supports. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits. The fruit of typical cultivars of cucumber is roughly cylindrical, but elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 60 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (3.9 in) in diameter. Botanically speaking, the cucumber is classified as a pepo, a type of botanical berry with a hard outer rind and no internal divisions. Much like tomato and squash, it is often perceived, prepared and eaten as a vegetable. Cucumber fruits consist of 95% water (see nutrition table).","type":"Vegetable","alcohol":"No","abv":"0","flavour":"fresh","country":"India"},{"_id":{"$oid":"64f1d62869d8333cf1310148"},"ingredientThumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-medium":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","thumb-small":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/drinkify/ingredients/","title":"Vanilla vodka","description":" Vanilla vodka is vodka with a vanilla taste.
